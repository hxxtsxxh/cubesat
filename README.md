# cubesat
UGA SSRL 2nd Round

There are two folders inside this repo: `cubesat` and `cubesatInfo` which represent the two different pages that can be accessible through my website [cubesat.heetsworld.com].
I was not able to add code for both pages inside just one folder due to some issues I ran into with Vite, so I just instantiated the info page with another domain [cubesatinfo.heetsworld.com].
To access my website, just go to the first website listed! Thanks.
