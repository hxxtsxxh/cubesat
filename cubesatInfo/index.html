        <h2>ü§î In-Depth</h2>

        <p>
          NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) offers cost-effective access to space for U.S. educational institutions, museums, non-profits with an educational focus, and NASA centers, facilitating early career workforce development. The goal is to inspire and nurture the next generation of scientists, engineers, and technologists through the opportunity to conduct scientific research and showcase innovative technologies in space. This initiative, led by the Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) and supported by the Office of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (OSTEM), Science Mission Directorate (SMD), and Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), collaboratively streamlines and prioritizes CubeSat rideshare and deployment opportunities. CubeSats, a category of nanosatellites, are compact, cube-shaped spacecraft measured in standardized units (Us), with each unit occupying a 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm volume and typically weighing under 2 kg.

        <h2>üê∂ UGA's Contribution?</h2>

        <h3>The Spectral Ocean Color (SPOC) Satellite</h3>
        <p>
         The SPOC satellite, a 3U CubeSat, marked the University of Georgia's debut satellite mission when launched to the International Space Station on October 2, 2020. It began its mission on November 5, 2020, after deployment from the ISS. SPOC's primary objective was to conduct multispectral analysis off the Georgia coast, focusing on various environmental factors. This mission aimed to enhance data for the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research Program and provided data comparable to NASA's MODIS sensor.
        </p>
        <h3>The Multi-view Onboard Computational Imager (MOCI) Satellite</h3>
        <p>
         The MOCI satellite, a 6U CubeSat and the University of Georgia's second satellite, was selected through the University Nanosatellite Program (UNP-9). Its primary mission is to pioneer 3D modeling through structure from motion in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), generating Digital Elevation Models at a landscape scale‚Äîa groundbreaking feat for a CubeSat. MOCI will utilize custom algorithms for feature extraction, structure from motion, surface reconstruction, data compression, and oceanic anomaly detection, marking a significant advancement in CubeSat capabilities.
